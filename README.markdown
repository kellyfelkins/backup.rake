backup.rake
===========

This rake task was copied from 
[Tobias LÃ¼tke's blog](http://blog.leetsoft.com/ "Too-biased"). His article [Easy migration between Databases](http://blog.leetsoft.com/2006/5/29/easy-migration-between-databases) describes how to migrate data from database to another via rake, ActiveRecord, and yaml.

Unfortunately, the rake task needed a small update and comments to the blog entry are closed.
